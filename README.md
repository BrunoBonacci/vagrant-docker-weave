# vagrant-docker-weave

Multi nodes vagrant setup for Docker and Weave testing.

This Vagrant project allows you to easily setup and test multiple
configuration of Docker and Weave.

## Documentation convensions

We will have to execute a number of different commands in different boxes.
To easily identify which box are we referring to we will follow this convension:

    $ echo "this is the host machine, like your laptop"
    node2$ echo "this is a command to execute in the Vagrant node2"
    cnt1$ echo "this command is to be run inside the container1"

To start the cluster run:

    $ vagrant up

To ssh into any of the three nodes just type:

    $ vagrant ssh <node_name>
    
Example, to ssh into node 3 type:

    $ vagrant ssh node3

To access a specific container first you need to ssh into the node which is hosting
the container, then run

    $ docker attach <container-id>

the `container-id` can be retrieved with

    $ docker ps

To stop the cluster:

    $ vagrant halt

To dispose the cluster

    $ vagrant destroy


## Usage

You can start the cluster of nodes with:

    $ vagrant up

This will start 3 nodes with a host-only network set up on `20.20.20.21/24`.
Every node will `have docker` and `weave` pre-installed.

Generally we are going to try to create a network topology for our containers
as the main container network. For this reason our container will be started
specifying `--net=none` to Docker to instruct it to not create the default container's network.
Where this is not possible I will highlight case by case.

For a more interative session I do suggest to open at least three independent terminal windows
and ssh into all three nodes.
Then you can choose any of the following sample and run the node setup scripts.

  * [Simple network](001-simple-network) - single network with three containers on a private network
  * [Two isolated networks](002-isolated-networks) - two networks which are isolated from each other.
  * [Exposing a network](003-external-access) - how to give access to a network from the outside world.
  * [Network with DNS](004-working-with-DNS) - Sample of Weave DNS with docker containers
